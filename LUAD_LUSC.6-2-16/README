Using Shiny for some R related projects

LUAD vs LUSC from TCGA EXAMPLE:

# Clone this repository (example assumes that you clone into a directory called ~/git/).
# From shell"
https://github.com/DrOppenheimer/Shiny_fun.git
# Start R
R
# Go to the GEUVADIS directory in the repository
# from R prompt
setwd("./Shiny_fun/LUAD_LUSC.6-2-16")
#  Run this command
runApp("./")
# That's it -- R may complain if you need to install requisite packages
