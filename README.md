Using Shiny for some R related projects

GEUVADIS EXAMPLE:

# Clone this repository (example assumes that you clone into a directory called ~/git/).
# From shell"
cd  ~/git
git clone https://github.com/DrOppenheimer/

# Start R
# Go to the GEUVADIS directory in the repository
# from R prompt
setwd("~/git/Shiny_fun/GEUVADIS")
#  Run this command
runApp("./")
# That's it -- R may complain if you need to install requisite packages
